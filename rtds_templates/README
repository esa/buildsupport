This directory contains templates for RTDS projects.

These templates are included in buildsupport binary and customized when needed, to cope with actual RTDS subsystems names/paths.

If you need to modify them, use the bin2header tool to create a .h file, and move this file to buildsupport/include directory, in place of the original one.
